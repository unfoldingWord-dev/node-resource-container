#Look

Here and in verse 16 the word "look" adds emphasis to what follows.

"Live wherever you want"

#It is to cover any offense against you in the eyes of all that are with you

Giving money to prove to others that Sarah is innocent is spoken of as if he is placing a cover over an offense so no one can see it. AT: "I am giving this to him, so that those who are with you will know that you have done nothing wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#in the eyes

Here "eyes" stands for a person's thoughts or opinion. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#before everyone, you are completely made right

The passive phrase "made right" can be stated in active form. AT: "everyone will know that you are innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
