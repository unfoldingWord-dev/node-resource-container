#birthright

"right as firstborn to inherit most of our father's wealth" (UDB)

#I am about to die

Esau was exaggerating to emphasize how hungry he was. AT: "I am so hungry I feel like I could die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

#What good is the birthright to me?

Esau used a question to emphasize that eating was more important than a birthright. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "My inheritance is no good to me if I die of hunger!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#First swear to me

What Jacob wanted Esau to swear can be stated explicitly. AT: "First swear to me that you will sell me your birthright" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#lentils

These are like beans, but their seeds are very small, round, and somewhat flat. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])

#Esau despised his birthright

"Esau showed that he did not value his birthright"
