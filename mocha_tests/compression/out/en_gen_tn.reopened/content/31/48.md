#This pile is a witness between me and you

The stones do not actually bear witness as a person. AT: "This pile will be a reminder between me and you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

#Galeed

See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:31:45|31:47]].

#Mizpah

Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Mizpah means 'watchtower.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

#when we are out of sight one from another

Here "out of sight" stands for no longer being in each other's presence. AT: "when we are no longer with each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#although no one else is with us

Here "us" refers to Laban and Jacob. AT: "even if no one else is there to see us"

#see

This adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "remember"
