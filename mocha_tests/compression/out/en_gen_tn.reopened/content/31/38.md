Jacob continues to speak to Laban.

#twenty years

"20 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

#ewes

female sheep

#have not miscarried

This means they have not had a pregnancy end early and unexpectedly with the lamb or kid born dead.

#What was torn by beasts I did not bring to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "When a wild animal killed one of your animals I did not bring it to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#Instead, I bore the loss of it

For Jacob to count Laban's dead animals as a loss from his own flock is spoken of as if it was a burden he would bear on his shoulders. AT: "Instead of counting it a loss from your flock, I counted it as a loss from my flock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#There I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night

Suffering in the hot and cold temperatures is spoken of as if the temperatures were animals that were eating Jacob. AT: "I stayed with your flocks even during hottest part of the day and the coldest part of the night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
