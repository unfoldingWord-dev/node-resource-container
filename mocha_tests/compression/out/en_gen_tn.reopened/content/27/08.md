#General Information:

Rebekah continues to speak to her younger son Jacob.

#Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

#obey my voice as I command you

Rebekah said "my voice" to refer to what she was saying. AT: "obey me and do what I tell you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#I will make delicious food from them for your father, just like he loves

See how a similar sentence was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:27:03|27:4]].

#You will take it to your father

"Then take it to your father"

#so that he may eat it, so that he may bless you

"and after he eats it, he will bless you"

#he may bless you

The word "bless" refers to the formal blessing a father pronounces on his children.

#before his death

"before he dies"
