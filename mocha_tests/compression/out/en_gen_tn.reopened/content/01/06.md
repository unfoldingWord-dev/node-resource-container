#Let there be an expanse ... let it divide

These are commands. By commanding that the expanse should exist and that it divide the waters, God made it exist and divide the waters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])

#expanse

"large empty space." The Jewish people thought of this space as being shaped like the inside of dome or the inside of a bowl that is turned upside down.

#between the waters

"in the water"

#God made the expanse and divided the waters

"In this way God made the expanse and divided the waters." When God spoke, it happened. This sentence explains what God did when he spoke.

#It was so

What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning. AT: "It happened like that" or "That is what happened."
