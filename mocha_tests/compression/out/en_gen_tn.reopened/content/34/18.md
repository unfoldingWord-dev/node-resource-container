#Their words pleased Hamor and his son Shechem

Here "words" stands for what was said. AT: "Hamor and his son Shechem agreed with what Jacob's sons said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#to do what they said

"to become circumcised"

#Jacob's daughter

"Jacob's daughter Dinah"

#because he was the most honored person in all his father's household

This can be translated as a new sentence. It can be made explicit that Shechem knew the other men would agree to be circumcised because they greatly respected him. AT: "Shechem knew all the men in his father's household would agree with him because he was the most honored among them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
