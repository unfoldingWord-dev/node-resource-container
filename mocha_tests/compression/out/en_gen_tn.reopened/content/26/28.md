#they said

This refers to Abimelech, Ahuzzath, and Phicol. One of them spoke and the other two agreed with what he said. It does not mean they all spoke at the same time. AT: "one of them said"

#We have clearly seen

"We know" or "We are certain"

#So let us make a covenant

"So we want to make a covenant"

#as we have treated you well

This can also be translated as the beginning of a new sentence as it is in the UDB. AT: "As we have done only good to you"

#you are blessed by Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has blessed you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
