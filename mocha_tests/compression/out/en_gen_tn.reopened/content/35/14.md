#pillar

This is a memorial pillar which was simply a large stone or boulder set up on its end.

#He poured out a drink offering over it and poured oil on it

This is a sign that he is dedicating the pillar to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])

#Bethel

Translators may also add a footnote that says "The name Bethel means 'house of God.'"
