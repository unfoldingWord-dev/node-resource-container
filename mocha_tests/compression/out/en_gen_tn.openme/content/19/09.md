#Stand back!

"Step aside!" or "Get out of our way!" (UDB)

#This one came here to live as a foreigner

"This one came here as an outsider" or "This foreigner came to live here"

#This one

Lot. The men are speaking to each other. If this would be unclear in your language, you may have the men speak to Lot here, as in UDB.

#and now he has become our judge

"and now he thinks he has the right to tell us what is right and what is wrong" or "but we are not going to allow him to stop us from doing what we want to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#and now he

"and even though he has no good reason to, he" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#Now we

"Because you are telling us that what we are doing is wrong, we"

#we will deal worse with you than with them

The men are angry that Lot said, "Do not act so wickedly" ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:19:06|19:7]]), so they are threatening to act more wickedly than Lot had feared at first. "we will act more wickedly with you than we will with them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#They pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near to break down the door

Possible meanings are 1) "They kept coming closer to the man, to Lot, until they were close enough to break down the door" or 2) they physically pushed Lot up against the wall or door of the house and were about to break the door down.

#the man ... Lot

This is two ways of referring to Lot.
