#Then the men said

"Then the two men said" or "Then the angels said"

#Do you have anyone else here?

"Are there any other members of your family in the city?" or "Do you have any other family members in this place?"

#whoever you have in the city

"any other members of your family living in this city"

#we are about to destroy

The word "we" here is exclusive. Only the two angels would destroy the city; Lot would not destroy it. If your language has an exclusive form of "we," use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

#the accusations against it before Yahweh have become so loud

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "accusations" is expressed as a verb. AT: "so many people have been telling Yahweh that the people of this city are doing evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and how similar words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:18:20|18:20]].)
