#The two angels

Genesis 18 says that two men went to Sodom. Here we learn that they are really angels. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:18:22|18:22]])

#the gate of Sodom

"the entrance to the city of Sodom." The city had a wall around it, and people had to go through a gate to get into it. This was a very important place in a city. Important people often spent time there.

#bowed down with his face to the ground

He put his knees on the ground then touched his forehead and nose to the ground.

#my masters

This was a term of respect Lot used for the angels.

#I urge you to turn aside into your servant's house

"Please come and stay in your servant's house"

#your servant's house

Lot refers to himself as their servant in order to show them respect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

#wash your feet

People liked to wash their feet after traveling.

#rise up early

"wake up early"

#we will spend the night

When the two angels said this, they were referring only to themselves, not to Lot. The two of them planed to spend the night in the square. Some languages would use the exclusive form of "we" here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

#town square

This is a public, outdoor place in the town.

#they went with him

"they turned and went with him"
