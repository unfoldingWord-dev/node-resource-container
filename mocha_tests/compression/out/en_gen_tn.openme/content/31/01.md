#Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author starts to tell a new part of the story.

#Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, that they said

Here "words" stands for what they were saying. AT: "Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#Jacob has taken away all that was our father's

Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. AT: "Everything that Jacob has taken belonged to our father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

#Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed

These two sentences mean basically the same thing. The second explains the look that Jacob saw on Laban's face. AT: "Jacob noticed that Laban was no longer pleased with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

#your fathers

"your father Isaac and your grandfather Abraham"
