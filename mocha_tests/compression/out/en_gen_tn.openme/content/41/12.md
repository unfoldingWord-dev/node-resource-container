#General Information:

The chief cupbearer continues to speak to Pharaoh.

#There was with us there

"In prison there was with the chief baker and me"

#captain of the guard

See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:40:01|40:3]].

#We told him and he interpreted for us our dreams

"We told him our dreams and he explained their meanings to us"

#He interpreted for each of us according to his dream

Here "his" refers to the cupbearer and baker individually, not to the one interpreting the dream. AT: "He explained what was going to happen to both of us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

#It came about

This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.

#as he interpreted for us, so it happened

"what he explained about the dreams is what later happened"

#Pharaoh restored me to my post

Here the cupbearer uses Pharaoh's title in speaking to him as a way of honoring him. AT: "You allowed me to return to my job" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

#the other one

"the chief baker"

#he hanged

Here "he" refers to Pharaoh. And, it stands for the soldiers that Pharaoh commanded to hang the chief baker. AT: "you ordered your soldiers to hang" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
