Travelling to Egypt is always considered as going "down" in contrast to going "up" to the promised land. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Ishmaelites had taken Joseph to Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#Yahweh was with Joseph

#He lived in the house
