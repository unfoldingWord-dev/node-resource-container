#Judah told him

"Judah told his father Jacob"

#The man

This refers to Joseph, but the brothers did not know it was Joseph. They referred to him as "the man" or "the man, the lord of the land" as in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:42:29|42:30]].

#warned us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'

This has a quotation within a quotation. It can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "warned us that we would not see his face unless we brought our youngest brother with us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])

#solemnly warned us

"was very serious when he warned us, saying"

#You will not see my face

Judah uses this phrase twice in 43:3-5 to emphasize to his father that they cannot return to Egypt without Benjamin. The phrase "my face" refers to the man, who is Joseph. AT: "You will not see me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])

#your brother is with you

Judah is referring to Benjamin, Rachel's last born before she died.

#we will not go down

It was common to use the phrase "go down" when speaking of traveling from Canaan to Egypt.
