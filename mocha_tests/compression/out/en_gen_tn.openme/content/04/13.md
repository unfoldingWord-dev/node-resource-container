#I will be hidden from your face

"I will not be able to come before your face" or "I will not be able to go to you." Cain thought that if he moved to a different place, he would not be able to worship God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) It does not mean that God would not be able to see Cain.

#a fugitive and a wanderer

Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:04:10|4:12]]

#vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold

This can be translated with an active verb. "I will take vengeance on him seven times" or "I will punish that person seven times as severely as I am punishing you" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#would not attack him

"would not kill Cain"
