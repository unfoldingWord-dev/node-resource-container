#Cain spoke to Abel his brother

Some languages will need to add the implicit information that Cain spoke to his brother about going to the fields. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#brother

Abel was Cain's younger brother. Some languages would need to use the word for "younger brother." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#rose up against

"attacked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#Where is Abel your brother

God knew that Cain had killed Abel, but he asked Cain this question so that Cain would have to answer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#Am I my brother's keeper?

Cain used this rhetorical question in order to avoid telling the truth. He was implying that God should know that Cain was not his brother's keeper. AT: "I am not my brother's keeper." or "Taking care of my brother is not my job." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
