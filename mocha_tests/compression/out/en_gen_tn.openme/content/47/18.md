#they came to him

"the people came to Joseph"

#We will not hide from my master

The people refer to Joseph as "my master." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in second person. AT: "We will not hide from you, our master" or "We will not hide from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

#There is nothing left in the sight of my master

Here "sight" stands Joseph himself. AT: "We have nothing left to give you, our master" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land?

The word "eyes" refers to Joseph's sight. The people use a question to emphasize how desperate they are to buy food. AT: "Please do not just watch as we die and our land is ruined!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#Why should we die ... both we and our land

The land becoming useless and ruined because there is no seed to plant is spoken of as if the land would die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
