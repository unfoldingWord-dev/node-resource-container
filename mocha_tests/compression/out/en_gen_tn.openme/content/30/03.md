#She said

"Rachel said"

#See

This adds emphasis to what Rachel says next. AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

#there is my servant Bilhah ... I will have children by her

At that time, this was an acceptable way for a barren woman to have children that would legally belong to her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#Bilhah

This is the name of Rachel's female servant. See how you translated this name in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:29:28|29:29]].

#on my knees

This is a way of saying that the child that Bilhah gives birth to will belong to Rachel. AT: "for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#I will have children by her

"and in this way she will cause me to have children"
