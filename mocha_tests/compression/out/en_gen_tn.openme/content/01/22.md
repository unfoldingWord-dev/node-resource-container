#blessed them

"blessed the animals that he had made"

#Be fruitful and multiply

This is God's blessing. He told the sea animals to produce more sea animals like themselves, so that there would be many of them in the seas. The word "multiply" explains how they are to be "fruitful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#multiply

"increase greatly in number" or "become many"

#Let birds multiply

This is a command. By commanding that birds should multiply, God made birds multiply. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
