#God blessed them

The word "them" refers to the man and woman God had created.

#Be fruitful, and multiply

See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:22|1:22]]. God told the man and the woman to produce more people like themselves so that there would be many of them. The word "multiply" explains how they are to be "fruitful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#Fill the earth

Fill the earth with people.
