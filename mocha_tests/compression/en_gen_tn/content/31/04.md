#Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock

"Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah and told them to meet him out in the field with the flocks"

#to his flock and said to them

This can be stated with a new sentence. AT: "to his flock. He said to them"

#I see your father's attitude toward me has changed

"I have noticed your father is no longer pleased with me"

#You know that it is with all my strength that I have served your father

The word "you" here refers to both Rachel and Leah. It also adds emphasis. AT: "You yourselves know that I have served your father with all my strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
