#It came about after these things

"After these events." The phrase "these things" refers to the events of Genesis 22:1-19. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])

#Abraham was told

This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone told Abraham" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#Milcah has borne children, as well

"Milcah has also borne children"

#Milcah

This is the name of a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

#They were Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother

"The name of his first born was Uz, and the names of the rest of his children were Buz his brother"

#Uz ... Buz ... Kemuel ... Aram ... Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel

These are all names of men. Translate this so that it is clear that all of these except Aram are the sons of Nahor and Milcah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
