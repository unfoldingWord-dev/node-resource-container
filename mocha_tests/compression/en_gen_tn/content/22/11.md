The words "I" and "me" refer to Yahweh. When translating what is in the quote, do it as the angel of Yahweh did and use the words "I" and "me" when referring to Yahweh.

#you fear God

This refers to deeply respecting God and showing that respect by obeying him.

#seeing that

"because I see that"

#you have not withheld your son ... from me

"you have not held back your son ... from me." This can be stated in positive form. AT: "you were willing to offer your son ... to me"
