#But the men

"But Lot's two guests" or "But the two angels"

#the men reached out their hands and brought ... them and shut

Your language may need to add that the men opened the door first. AT: 'the men opened the door far enough so they could reach out their hands and pull ... them, and then they shut" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#Lot's visitors attacked them with blindness

"Lot's visitors blinded them" or "they took away their sight." The phrase "attacked them" is a metaphor; the visitors did not physically hit the men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#both young and old

"men of all ages." This merism emphasizes that the visitors blinded all the men. AT: "both small and great." This could indicate social standing rather than age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])

#so that they wore themselves out trying to find the door

"so that they got tired of trying to find the door" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
