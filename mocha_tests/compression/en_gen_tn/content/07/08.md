#General Information:

Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event.

#clean animals

These were animals that God allowed people to eat and to give to him as sacrifices.

#unclean animals

These were animals that God did not allow people to eat and to give to him as sacrifices.

#two by two

The animals entered the boat in pairs of one male and one female.

#It came about that

This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the storyâ€”the start of the flood. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.

#after the seven days

"after seven days" or "seven days later"

#the water of the flood came upon the earth

The implicit information that it rained can be made explicit as it is in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
