#Two of all flesh

This refers to the animals.

#in which was the breath of life

"Breath" is a metonym for being alive. AT: "that lived" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#all flesh

Translate these words as in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:06:11|6:12]].

#after them

"after they entered the ark" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
