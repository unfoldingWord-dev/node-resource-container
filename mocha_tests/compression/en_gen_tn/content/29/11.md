#Jacob kissed Rachel

In ancient Near East, it is common to greet a relative with a kiss. However, it is normally done between men. If your language has an affectionate greeting for a relative, use that. If not, use what is appropriate.

#wept loudly

Jacob weeps because he is so happy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#her father's relative

"related to her father"
