#Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them

"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them"

#he disguised himself to them

"he acted like he was not their brother" or "he did not let them know that he was their brother"

#Where have you come from?

This was not a rhetorical question even though Joseph knew the answer. It was part of his choice to keep his identity from his brothers.
