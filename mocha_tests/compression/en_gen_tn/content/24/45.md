#General Information:

Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

#speaking in my heart

To pray silently in one's mind is spoken of as if he were speaking in his heart. The word "heart" refers to his thoughts and his mind. AT: "praying" (UDB) or "praying quietly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. AT: "indeed" or "suddenly."

#pitcher

See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:15|24:15]].

#she went down to the spring

The phrase "went down" is used because the spring was somewhere lower than where the servant was standing.

#spring

"well"

#watered the camels

"gave water to the camels"
