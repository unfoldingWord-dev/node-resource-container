#General Information:

Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

#The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him

"My father is Bethuel. His parents are Nahor and Milcah"

#ring ... bracelets

See how you translated these in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:21|24:22]].

#I bowed down

This is a sign of humility before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])

#led me by the right way

"brought me here"

#who had led me

The connecting word "because" can be used to show this is why the servant worshiped God. AT: "because Yahweh led me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]])

#my master's relative

This refers to Bethuel, the son of Abraham's brother Nahor.
