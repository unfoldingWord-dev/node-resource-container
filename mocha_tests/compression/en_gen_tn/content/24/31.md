#Come

"Come in" or "Enter"

#you blessed of Yahweh

"you whom Yahweh has blessed"

#you

Here the word "you" refers to Abraham's servant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

#Why are you standing outside?

Laban used this question to invite Abraham's servant into his house. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You do not need to stay outside." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#So the man came to the house

The word "came" can be translated as "went." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])

#he unloaded the camels

It is not clear who did this work. This may be stated in active form. AT: "Laban's servants unloaded the camels" (UDB) or "the camels were unloaded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#The camels were given straw and feed, and water was provided

This does not say who did the work. If you state this in active form use "Laban's servants" as the subject. AT: "Laban's servants gave straw and feed to the camels, and they provided water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#to wash his feet ... him

"for Abraham's servant and the men who were with him to wash their feet"
