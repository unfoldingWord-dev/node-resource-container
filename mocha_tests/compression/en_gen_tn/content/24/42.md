#the spring

"the well"

#here I am, standing by the spring of water

The servant interrupted what he was asking God to do by drawing God's attention to where he was standing.

#let the young woman who comes ... the woman to whom I say ... the woman who says to me

The servant went back to stating his request, and he had three things to say about the woman that he hoped would come.

#to draw water

"to get water"

#pitcher

See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:15|24:15]].

#let her be the woman

The servant finished his request.
