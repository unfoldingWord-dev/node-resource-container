#General Information:

Isaac continues speaking to Jacob

#make you fruitful and multiply you

The word "multiply" explains how God would make Jacob "fruitful." AT: "give you many children and descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])

#May he give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your descendants after you

This speaks about blessing someone as if a blessing were an object that a person can give. The abstract noun "the blessing" can be stated as "bless." AT: "May God bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham" or "May God give to you and your descendants what he promised to Abraham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])

#that you may inherit the land

God giving the land of Canaan to Jacob and his descendants is spoken of as if a child were inheriting money or possessions from his father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#the land where you have been living

"the land where you have been staying"

#which God gave to Abraham

"which God promised to Abraham"
