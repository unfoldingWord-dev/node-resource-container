#Jacob cooked

Since this is the beginning of a story about something that happened one time, some translators may want to start it with a phrase like "One day, Jacob cooked" in a similar manner to the UDB.

#cooked some stew

"boiled some food" or "cooked some soup." This stew was made of boiled lentils. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:25:31|25:34]])

#he was weak from hunger

"he was weak because he was very hungry" or "he was very hungry"

#I am exhausted

"I am weak from hunger" or "I am very hungry"

#Edom

Translators may add a footnote that says "The name Edom means 'red.'"
