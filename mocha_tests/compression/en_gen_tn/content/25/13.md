#These were Ishmael's sons, and these were their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their tribes

This can be stated as two sentences. AT: "These were the names of Ishmael's twelve sons. They led tribes that were named after them, and they each had their own villages and campsites"

#twelve

"12" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

#princes

Here the word "princes" means that the men were leaders or rules of the tribes; it does not mean that they were the sons of a king.
