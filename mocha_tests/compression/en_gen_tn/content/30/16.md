#God has given me my wages

God rewarding Leah is spoken of as if he were a boss paying wages to someone who works for him. AT: "God has given my due" or "God has rewarded me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#She called his name Issachar

Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Issachar means 'there is a reward.'"
