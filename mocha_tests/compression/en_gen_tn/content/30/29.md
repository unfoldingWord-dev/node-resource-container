#Jacob said to him

"Jacob said to Laban"

#how your livestock have fared with me

"how well your livestock have done since I started taking care of them"

#For you had little before I came

"your herds were small before I worked for you"

#and it has increased abundantly

"but now your wealth has greatly increased"

#Now when will I provide for my own household also?

"Now when will I take care of my own family?" Jacob uses a question to emphasize that he wants to start providing for his own family. AT: "Now I want to take care of my family!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
