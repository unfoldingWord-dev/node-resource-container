"in front of the sticks"

#the feebler animals

"the weaker animals"

"So the weaker offspring belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring belonged to Jacob." You can make this even more explicit. AT: "So the weaker offspring did not have stripes or spots and so belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring did have stripes or spots and so belonged to Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
