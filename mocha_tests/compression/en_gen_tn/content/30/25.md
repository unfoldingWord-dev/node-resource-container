#After Rachel had borne Joseph

"After Rachel gave birth to Joseph"

#and let me go

"so I can go"

#you know the service I have given you

Jacob is reminding Laban of their contract ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:29:26|Gen 29:27]]). The abstract noun "service" can be stated as "served." AT: "you know that I have served you long enough" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
