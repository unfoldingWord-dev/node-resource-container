#Give me the people

The phrase "the people" may refer to the people of Sodom that the enemies had captured. Abram rescued them when he rescued Lot.

#I have lifted up my hand

This means "I have taken an oath" or "I have made a promise."

#I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten

Abram was refusing to accept anything for himself, but acknowledged that the soldiers had eaten some of the supplies during the journey back to Sodom after the battle. AT: "I take from you only what my young men have already eaten."

#the share of the men that went with me

"the share of the recovered property that belongs to the men who helped me get it back." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre

These are the allies of Abram (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:13|14:13]]). Because they were Abram's allies they fought battles alongside him. AT: "my allies Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
