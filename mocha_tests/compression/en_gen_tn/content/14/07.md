#General Information:

Verses 8 and 9 repeats what was said in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:03|14:3]] and continues to tell what happened when the kings came together to fight.

#they turned and came

The word "they" refers to the four foreign kings who were attacking the region of Canaan. Their names were Amraphel, Arioch, Chedorlaomer, and Tidal. AT: "they turned and went" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])

#the Amorites who lived in Hazazon Tamar

This phrase tells which Amorite people were defeated. There were other Amorite people who lived in other places.

#the king of Bela (also called Zoar)

The city of Bela was also called Zoar. This information could also be put at the end of the sentence: "and the king of Bela went out and prepared for battle. Bela is also called Zoar."

#prepared for battle

"joined battle" or "drew up battle lines." Some translators may need to also say that the armies fought, as the UDB does in verse 9. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#four kings against the five

Since the five kings were listed first, some languages might prefer to translate this as "five kings against four."
