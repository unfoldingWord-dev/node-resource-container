#Now

This word introduces background information about the valley of Siddim. Your language may have another way of introducing background information. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

#was full of tar pits

"had many tar pits." These were holes in the ground that had tar in them. See how you translated "tar" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:11:03|11:3]].

#the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah

This is a metonym for the kings and their armies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#they fell in there

Possible meanings are 1) some of their soldiers fell in the tar pits or 2) the kings themselves fell in the tar pits. Since [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:17|14:17]] says that the king of Sodom went to meet Abram, the first meaning is more likely correct. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, along with all his possessions

The phrases "Abram's brother's son" and "who was living in Sodom" remind the reader of things that were written earlier about Lot. AT: "they also took Lot along with all his possessions. Lot was Abram's brother's son and was living in Sodom at that time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
