#Then, behold

The word "behold" emphasizes the fact that the word of Yahweh came to Abraham again.

#the word of Yahweh came

"Yahweh spoke his word." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:15:01|15:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#This man

Eliezer of Damascus. "Your servant"

#the one who will come from your own body

Abram's own son would become his heir. AT: "the one that you will father" or "your very own son."

#number the stars

"count the stars"

#So will your descendants be

Just as Abram would not be able to count all the stars, he would not be able to count all his descendants because there would be so many.
