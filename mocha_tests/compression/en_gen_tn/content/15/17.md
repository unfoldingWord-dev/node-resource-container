#behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

#a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between the pieces

God did this to show Abram that he was making a covenant with him.

#passed between the pieces

"passed through between the two rows of animal pieces"

#covenant

In this covenant God promises to bless Abram, and he will continue to bless him as long as Abram follows him.

#I hereby give this land

By saying this, God was giving the land to Abram's descendants. God was doing this then, but the descendants would not go into the land until many years later.

#the great river, the Euphrates

"the large river, the Euphrates." This is two ways of referring to the same river.

#the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites

These are the names of groups of people who lived in that land. God would allow Abraham's descendants to conquer these people and take their land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
