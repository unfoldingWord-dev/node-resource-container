#General Information:

Abraham continues talking to Yahweh.

#Perhaps there are

"Suppose there are"

#Will you sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there?

Abraham was hoping that Yahweh would say, "I will not sweep it away." AT: "I think you would not sweep it away. Instead, you would spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#sweep it away

"destroy it." Abraham speaks of destroying people as if it were sweeping dirt with a broom. AT: "destroy the people who live there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there?

Abraham was hoping that God would say "I will spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people there."

#spare the place

"let the people live"

#for the sake of

"because of"

#Far be it from you to do such a thing

"I would never want you to do something like that" or "You should not want to do something like that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#such a thing, killing

"such a thing as killing" or "such a thing, that is, killing"

#the righteous should be treated the same as the wicked

This can be active. AT: "you should treat the righteous the same way you treat the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?

Abraham used this rhetorical question to say what he expected God to do. AT: "The Judge of all the earth will certainly do what is just." or "Since you are the Judge of all the earth, you will surely do what is right." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#Judge

God is often referred to as a judge because he is the one perfect judge who makes the final decisions about what is right or wrong.
