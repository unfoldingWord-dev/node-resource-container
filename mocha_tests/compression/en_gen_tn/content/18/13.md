#Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really bear a child, when I am old'?

God used this rhetorical question to show that he knew what Sarah was thinking and that he was not pleased with it. He repeats Sarah's rhetorical question ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:18:11|18:12]]) using different words. AT: "Sarah was wrong to laugh and say, 'I will not bear a child because I am too old.'"(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#Is anything too hard for Yahweh?

"Is there anything that Yahweh cannot do?" Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were speaking of someone else to remind Abraham that he, Yahweh, is great and can do anything. AT: "There is nothing that I, Yahweh, cannot do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#At the time appointed by me, in the spring

"At the time I have appointed, which is in the spring"

#Then Sarah denied it and said

"The Sarah denied it by saying"

#He replied

"Yahweh replied"

#No, you did laugh

This means "No, that is not true; you did in fact laugh." AT: "Yes, you did laugh."
