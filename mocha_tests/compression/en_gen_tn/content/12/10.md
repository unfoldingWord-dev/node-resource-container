"There was no food available" or "There was a shortage of food." AT: "The crops did not grow well that season."

#in the land

#went down into

Possible meanings are 1) "went south into" (see UDB) or 2) "went away from Canaan into." It would be best to translate this using your usual words for going from a higher place to a lower place.

#they will kill me

The reason they would kill Abram can be made explicit: "they will kill me so that they can marry you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#so that my life will be spared because of you

This can be made active. "so that, because of you, they will not kill me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
