#He continued on his journey

"He traveled by stages" or "He continued traveling from place to place." Abram took his household along, AT: "They continued on their journey."

#to the place where his tent had been before

The time can be made explicit: "to the place where he had set up his tent before he went to Egypt." Translators may add a footnote that says "See Genesis 12:8." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

#called on the name of Yahweh

"prayed in the name of Yahweh" or "worshiped Yahweh." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:08|12:8]].
