#General Information:

Joseph continues to counsel Pharaoh

#Let them gather

"Allow the overseers to gather"

#of these good years that are coming

This speaks of years as if they are something that travels and comes to a place. AT: "during the good years that will soon happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#Let them store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities

The phrase "under the authority of Pharaoh" means Pharaoh gives them authority. AT: "Give them the authority to store the grain for food in the cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

#Let them guard it

Most likely the overseers would have soldiers protect the grain. AT: "Let the overseers leave soldiers there to guard the grain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#The food will be a supply for the land

Here "land" refers to the people. AT: "This food will be for the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#In this way the land will not be devastated by the famine

Here "land" stands for the people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "This way the people will not starve during the famine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
