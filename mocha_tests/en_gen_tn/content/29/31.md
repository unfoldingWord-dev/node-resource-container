#Leah was not loved

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jacob did not love Leah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#not loved

This is an exaggeration to emphasize that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah. AT: "loved less than Rachel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

#so he opened her womb

God causing Leah to be able to become pregnant is spoken of as if God is opening her womb. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#was childless

"was not able to become pregnant"

#Leah conceived and bore a son

"Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son"

#she called his name Reuben

Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Reuben means 'See, a son.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

#Yahweh has looked upon my affliction

Leah was experiencing emotional pain because Jacob had rejected her. The abstract noun "affliction" can be stated as a verb. AT: "Yahweh saw that I was suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
