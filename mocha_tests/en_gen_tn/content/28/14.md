#General Information:

God continues to talk to Jacob in a dream.

#Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth

God compares Jacob's descendants to the dust of the earth to emphasize their huge number. AT: "You will have more descendants than you can count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

#and you will spread far out to the west

Here the word "you" is singular but refers to Jacob's descendants. It only speaks of Jacob since he is the leader of the family. AT: "and your descendants will spread out to the west" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])

#you will spread far out

This means the people will extend the borders of their land and occupy more territory.

#to the west, to the east, to the north, and to the south

This phrases are used together to mean "all directions." AT: "in all directions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])

#In you and in your descendants will all the families of the earth be blessed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bless all families on the earth through you and your descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

#Behold

This adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

#for I will not leave you. I will do all

"for I will not leave you until I have done all"

#I will keep you

"I will keep you safe" or "I will protect you"

#I will bring you into this land again

"I will bring you back to this land"
