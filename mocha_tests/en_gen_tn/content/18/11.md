#will I have this pleasure, my master being old also?

You may want to add "of having a baby" (UDB). Sarah used this rhetorical question because she did not believe that she could have a child. This means "I cannot believe that I will experience the joy of having a child. My master is also too old." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#my master being old also

This means "since my husband is also old."

#my master

This is a title of respect that Sarah gave to her husband Abraham.
