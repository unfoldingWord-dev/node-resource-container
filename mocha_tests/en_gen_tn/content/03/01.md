#Now

The writer is beginning a new part of the story.

#more shrewd

"more cunning" (UDB) or "smarter at getting what he wanted by telling lies"

#Has God really said, 'You ... garden'?

The snake is pretending to be surprised that God has made this rule. AT: "I am surprised that God said, 'You ... garden.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#You must not eat

The word "you" refers to the man and the woman and so is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

#We may eat ... God said, 'You may not eat it

Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do first and then what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do first and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UDB.

#We may eat

"We are allowed to eat" or "We have permission to eat"

#You may not ... nor may you ... you will die

The word "you" refers to the man and the woman and so is dual or plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

#You may not eat it

"You must not eat it" or "Do not eat it"

#nor may you touch it

"and you must not touch it" or "and do not touch it"

#or you will die

See how "die" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:15|2:17]].
