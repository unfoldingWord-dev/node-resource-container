#Let there be no strife between you and me

"Let's not quarrel"

#strife

"hostility" or "fighting" or "quarreling"

#and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen

"and let's stop the men who take care of our animals from quarreling"

#after all, we are family

"because we are family"

#family

"kinsmen" or "relatives." Lot was Abraham's nephew.

#Is not the whole land before you?

Abraham used this rhetorical question to remind Lot about something he would have already known. AT: "The whole land is available for you to use." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).

#Go ahead and separate yourself

Abraham was speaking kindly to Lot and encouraging him to do something that would help them both. AT: "Let's separate."

#If you go to the left, then I will go to the right

Possible meanings are 1) "If you go one way, then I will go the other" or 2) "If you go to the north, I will go to the south." Abraham let Lot choose the part of the land he wanted, and Abraham would take what was left.
