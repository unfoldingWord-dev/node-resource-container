#These are the twelve tribes of Israel

"These" refers to the sons Jacob mentioned in 49:1-27. Each son became the leader of his own tribe.

#when he blessed them

Here the word "blessed" refers to the speaking of formal blessings.

#Each one he blessed with an appropriate blessing

"He gave each son a fitting blessing"

#he instructed them

"he commanded them"

#I am about to go to my people

This is a polite way of saying he is about to die. The phrase "go to my people" means that after Jacob dies his soul will go to the same place where his ancestors are. AT: "I am about to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
