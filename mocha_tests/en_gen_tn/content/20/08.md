#He told all these things to them

"He told them everything that God had told him"

#What have you done to us?

Abimelech used this rhetorical question to accuse Abraham. AT: "You have done something bad to us!" or "Look what you have done to us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#to us

The word "us" here is exclusive and does not include Abraham and Sarah. If your language uses an exclusive form of "we" or "us," use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

#How have I sinned against you, that you have brought ... sin?

Abimelech used this rhetorical question to remind Abraham that he had not sinned against Abraham. AT: "I have done nothing against you to cause you to bring ... sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

#that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin

To cause someone to be guilty of sinning is spoken of as if "sin" were an object that placed on a person. AT: "that you should make me and my kingdom guilty of such a terrible sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

#on my kingdom

Here "kingdom" stands for the people. AT: "on the people of my kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

#You have done to me that which ought not to be done

"You should not have done this to me"
